                                        <p>Somewhere In 2011, I started out in IT as a computer hardware and networking engineer, and also database administrator. Three years later, perhaps of doing mostly database stuff and writing SQL code, I figured my passion is programming,
                                           so I decided to go full-time in the direction of software. Now as a self-made software engineer and architect,
                                           I design system software architecture, build systems fullstack-wise with modern frontend tech, and usually a java backend powered by Microsoft SQL server database.
                                        </p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>Since late 2017, I have written and maintained about a 100KSLOC of this web application called Queue (it lets people discover medical and beauty services and take line spots to book appointments,
                                            and also to view news updates that the businesses post to keep customers informed and engaged) <a href='http:/QueueWebAppPrototype/'>Click here to see Queue</a>. As a founder, CEO and project coordinator at AriesLab, I've led my dev teams to 
                                            substantial wins in various software projects. My most recent main focus has revolved around web development and software architecture with mastery on bare-bone coding in the various web dev programming languages.
                                            That means, I don't easily submit to cooky cutter solutions or frameworks, despite being able to do React, Java-Spring MVC and other frameworks. I also have years of experience in database development and administration
                                            which equips me with the ability to analyze, design, implement and maintain databases in MS SQL server using its respective management tools.

                                <p>Whether you're studying CS in college or enrolled in a boot camp, or self-teaching yourself programming, one thing holds true - in all cases, you need to put in hours and hours
                                   of work to develop your skills. Software is one of the highly paying industries where a college degree isn't required to land your first job.
                                   However, in order to get a programming job, you need to be equipped with specific skills required in the industry. This skills-set comes in the form of
                                   trending technologies you need to know, specific CS topics you need to master, and also your ability to understand the tech ecosystem properly.
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                <p>Hey there! My name is Mohammed Adinan. I'm 26 years old. I started out in IT when I was 18 years old. Over the course of 8 years in IT, out of which I've been doing 
                                    software for 5 years now, I've become a software engineer and architect after writing and seeing so much code and doing some architecture works as well. 
                                    As of 2014, I was traveling back and forth from Ghana (where I come from) to London to negotiate on hardware supply deals with London based hardware vendors
                                    on behalf of the Ghana Nation Youth Authority (N.Y.A), as I held a two year contract position as regional overall systems administrator and infrastructure coordinator of the NYA.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    In 2015, as my employment contract with the NYA was ending that year, I decided that I will establish a startup.
                                    Later that same year, I applied as NYA delegate to an upcoming UN Summit which was to be held here, in US. My application was successful, so I flew to NY.
                                    As I stayed in NY for some time, I felt it was a perfect opportunity for me to establish my Start-up in NY. 
                                    I started a small software business called AriSoft which unfortunately didn't succeed. A year later, after months of market research, learning and gathering resources
                                    and also making some strategic connections in the industry, I felt prepared to start again.
                                    Now as founder, CEO and Project coordinator at AriesLab, I've led my dev teams at AriesLab in many software projects to substantial successes. I've written and seen so much code, designed systems architectures, and managed
                                    my teams in technical areas, leading the company to many successes.
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                    Technology has become really complex nowadays, knowing only how to code isn't enough to justify your programmer capabilities. Programmers are expected to know, in addition to being able to write good code and implement effective algorithms, a handful of technologies
                                    and also how to use some specific tools in order to fit in the job-market. As a beginner, in order to be able to navigate this complex ecosystem of 
                                    technologies, you will need some help to identify what you should be learning, the order in which to pick and learn those needed technologies, and how to know when you're ready to start applying to jobs.
                                    Having someone who is experienced in tech, who can guide you through this journey is invaluable, I guess.

                                            Web applications usually have 3 main different parts; The Frontend, Backend and Database. Each separate part of the application has a different
                                            set of responsibilities for which it is meant to contribute to the entire application's functionalities.
                                            In order to be a fullstack web developer, you must have the knowledge that spans the frontend, the backend, and the database.
                                            Lets break it down so that you can get the bigger and better picture of how this can be achieved.

                                          This is the part of the application that the end users interact with. It main purpose is to provide the end user with some form of presentation where to interact with the application. It is basically a medium for input/output between the User and the Application.
                                          The diagram below demonstrates how the frontend(browser), the backend and the database exist in their relative positions.

                                            There are 3 main languages to learn in order to start building this part of your application; <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">HTML5</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS3</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" >Javascript</a>.

                                            This blog wont dive into any particular programming language, instead I'll give you a brief explanation of what each language is responsible for. I'll include links for resources to learn more about some of the programming languages I'll be introducing in this blog.

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>HTML5:</span> Every web page is made up of elements ( like text, pictures, boxes and other shapes, etc. ) which define the content of the web page. These Elements are coded into a file with a ".html" file extension and is of the html syntax.
                                            This makes it possible for the web browsers to read and create the webpages from the file. The webpage elements are represented in code with html tags. Most of such elements are made up of a start and a closing tags (like so, &lt;startTag&gt; content here &lt;/closeTag&gt;). 
                                            In between the start and closing tags is where to put the main content which should be displayed on the webpage. Elements have properties too, which help the browser understand what type of elements they are and how to display them on the webpage. 
                                            In oder to add properties to elements, you place them in the &lt;startTag&gt; in the form of name="value" like so &lt;startTag propertyname="value"&gt;. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">Click here for a beginners' HTML5 tutorial</a>

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>CSS3:</span> Webpages don't only have content, they also have designs. In order to make your webpage look attractive to the user, you need to write code that customize the appearances of the elements on the page. CSS3 is the language used for styling your webpage and making it look how attractive you want it to look.
                                            Example, if you want the heading to be of specific font, color, size, etc, you do that in CSS3 code, if you want a user's profile picture to be shaped as a circle  instead of a rectangle, you do that in CSS3 code as well. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">Click here for a beginners' CSS3 tutorial</a>

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>Javascript:</span> Modern websites are interactive; that is, the web pages don't get refreshed or redirected for every user click. Users are able to stay on the same webpage and perform various activities without having to refresh the webpage. This is achieved using Javascript code. 
                                            In order to add some interactivity to the webpages, you need to write javascript code which get executed inside the browser in response to various user activities. For example, when the user clicks on a drop-down menu icon, some javascript code is executed so that the actual drop-down menu appears on the screen. 
                                            Javascript can be quite heavy to get your head around if you have no prior programming experience. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" >Click here for a beginners' Javascript tutorial</a>

                                            As a  summary of what we've covered so far,  Frontend is the part of the application that the end user interacts with in order to use the application. It contains all the visual elements such as forms, buttons, menus, window panels, etc.
                                            In order to build this kind of presentation which can be displayed by the web browser, you create an html page which contains html elements written of the HTML5 language syntax, then add your design definitions using CSS3 code.
                                            Modern webpages aren't static pages with fixed contents, they allow the users to change parts of the webpages without having to refresh the pages all the time. Javascript is the language for implementing the behavioural part of the frontend.

                                            So far we've covered the first part of the application, now lets consider looking at the backend and how its different from the frontend.

                                        <p>
                                            The backend  of every software application is that which the end user isn't allowed to directly access its code, instead, the user only gets a feel of what exists in the backend by invoking its functions through interacting with the frontend. 
                                            This part of the application is responsible for some of the most complex applications functions and processes, such as user authentication, database interaction, data processing etc. When it comes to the programming languages for building the backend,
                                            there is a vast variety of languages to learn in order to write backend code and these languages usually have steep learning curves. This blog isn't meant to teach any set of specific languages, but what I will be doing is briefly introducing some of the
                                            very popular backend languages so as to give you a feel of what the backend  may comprise of. Some backend languages to condiser include Java (not the same as Javascript), Python, C#, Ruby, PHP, and even Javascript ( yes, you can use javascript on the backend too, it is called Node.js ).

                                            As a summery of what the backend is, it is the non-visual part of your application which contains code that runs on the server side. The code in the backend is usuaslly invoked indirectly by the users through interacting with the front-end, thus some of the frontend elements or features connect to various processes and functions in the backed code. 
                                            This code isn't accessible to the end user however, but through their direct actions on frontend elements, the backend code is activated. Some of the common things the backend is used for are user authentication, database read, write, update, delete, etc. operations, complex data processing, etc. Java, C#, Python, Javascript, Ruby, PHP etc. are some of the most popular backend languages.

                                        <p>
                                            The database is the data storage part of your application. It stores all the data that is generated by the end users and application processes in order to maintain data persistence. For example, if you need the users to create user accounts to be able to use the application, then you are going to need a place to store all this user generated data so that it can be later retrieved and used when needed. 
                                            Databases are a way to permanently store data. Databases come in two main general categories. These are the Relational or SQL databases and the NoSQL databases.

                                           Having covered all three main application concerns, the table is now set for us to look at what being a fullstack web developer means.

                                        <p>
                                            A fullstack web developer is someone who has knowledge of all the three main application concerns and is able to piece everything together to build the whole application.
                                            As a fullstack web developer, you are required to have the knowledge that spans all three main appliction concerns ( frontend, backend, database). You don't have to be an expert in all three, but atleast having a good understanding of one facet of the software stack  and being average on all other parts is required to meet the expectations of a fullstack web developer.
                                            The most conventional way to begin your journey is to pick one particular aspect, usually the frontend, and start learning the technologies and languages involved in building that part of the application. Thus being a fullstack web developer is only the ultimate goal, therefore needless do you have to focus on learning all three areas of the application at the same time.
