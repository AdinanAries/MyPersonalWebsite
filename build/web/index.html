                                        <p>Somewhere In 2011, I started out in IT as a computer hardware and networking engineer, and also database administrator. Three years later, perhaps of doing mostly database stuff and writing SQL code, I figured my passion is programming,
                                           so I decided to go full-time in the direction of software. Now as a self-made software engineer and architect,
                                           I design system software architecture, build systems fullstack-wise with modern frontend tech, and usually a java backend powered by Microsoft SQL server database.
                                        </p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>Since the last quarter of 2017, I have been writing and maintaining over a hundred thousand source lines of code (100KSLOC) for this particular web application called Queue (it lets people discover medical and beauty services and take line spots to book appointments,
                                            and also to view news updates that the businesses post to keep customers informed and engaged) <a href='http:/QueueWebAppPrototype/'>Click here to see Queue</a>. As a founder, CEO and project coordinator at AriesLab, I've led my dev teams to 
                                            substantial wins in various software projects. My most recent main focus has revolved around web development and software architecture with mastery on bare-bone coding in the various web dev programming languages.
                                            That means, I don't easily submit to cooky cutter solutions or frameworks, despite being able to do React, Java-Spring MVC and other frameworks. I also have years of experience in database development and administration
                                            which equips me with the ability to analyze, design, implement and maintain databases in MS SQL server using its respective management tools.

                                <p>Whether you're studying CS in college or enrolled in a boot camp, or self-teaching yourself programming, one thing holds true - in all cases, you need to put in hours and hours
                                   of work to develop your skills. Software is one of the highly paying industries where a college degree isn't required to land your first job.
                                   However, in order to get a programming job, you need to be equipped with specific skills required in the industry. This skills-set comes in the form of
                                   trending technologies you need to know, specific CS topics you need to master, and also your ability to understand the tech ecosystem properly.
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                <p>Hey there! My name is Mohammed Adinan. I'm 26 years old. I started out in IT when I was 18 years old. Over the course of 8 years in IT, out of which I've been doing 
                                    software for 5 years now, I've become a software engineer and architect after writing and seeing so much code and doing some architecture works as well. 
                                    As of 2014, I was traveling back and forth from Ghana (where I come from) to London to negotiate on hardware supply deals with London based hardware vendors
                                    on behalf of the Ghana Nation Youth Authority (N.Y.A), as I held a two year contract position as regional overall systems administrator and infrastructure coordinator of the NYA.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    In 2015, as my employment contract with the NYA was ending that year, I decided that I will establish a startup.
                                    Later that same year, I applied as NYA delegate to an upcoming UN Summit which was to be held here, in US. My application was successful, so I flew to NY.
                                    As I stayed in NY for some time, I felt it was a perfect opportunity for me to establish my Start-up in NY. 
                                    I started a small software business called AriSoft which unfortunately didn't succeed. A year later, after months of market research, learning and gathering resources
                                    and also making some strategic connections in the industry, I felt prepared to start again.
                                    Now as founder, CEO and Project coordinator at AriesLab, I've led my dev teams at AriesLab in many software projects to substantial successes. I've written and seen so much code, designed systems architectures, and managed
                                    my teams in technical areas, leading the company to many successes.
                                </p>
                                <br/>

                                    Technology has become really complex nowadays, knowing only how to code isn't enough to justify your programmer capabilities. Programmers are expected to know, in addition to being able to write good code and implement effective algorithms, a handful of technologies
                                    and also how to use some specific tools in order to fit in the job-market. As a beginner, in order to be able to navigate this complex ecosystem of 
                                    technologies, you will need some help to identify what you should be learning, the order in which to pick and learn those needed technologies, and how to know when you're ready to start applying to jobs.
                                    Having someone who is experienced in tech, who can guide you through this journey is invaluable, I guess.

                                            Web applications usually have 3 main different parts; The Frontend, Backend and Database. Each separate part of the application has a different
                                            set of responsibilities which it is meant to contribute to the overall application's functionalities.
                                            In order to be a fullstack web developer, you must have the knowledge that spans the frontend, the backend, and the database.

                                          The Frontend is the part of the application that the end users interact with. Its main purpose is to provide the end user with some form of presentation where to interact with the application. It is basically a presentation medium for input/output between the User and the Application.
                                          The diagram below demonstrates how the frontend(browser), the backend and the database exist relative to one another.

                                            There are 3 main languages to learn in order to start building the frontend part of your application; <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">HTML5</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS3</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" >Javascript</a>.

                                        <p>
                                            This blog wont dive into any particular programming language, instead I'll give you a brief explanation of what each language is responsible for. I'll include links for resources to learn more about some of the programming languages I'll be introducing in this blog.
                                        </P>
                                        <br/>

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>HTML5:</span> Every web page is made up of elements ( like text, pictures, boxes and other shapes, etc. ) which define the content of the web page. These Elements are coded into a file with a ".html" file extension and is of the html syntax.
                                            This makes it possible for the web browsers to read and display the web page from the file. The web page elements are represented in code with HTML tags. The HTML elements are usually made up of a start and a closing tags (like so, &lt;startTag&gt; content here &lt;/closeTag&gt;). 
                                            In between the start and closing tags is where to put the main content of the element which should be displayed on the webpage. Elements have properties too, which help the browser understand what type of elements they are and how to display them on the webpage. 
                                            In oder to add properties to elements, you place them in the &lt;startTag&gt; in the form of name="value" like so &lt;startTag propertyname="value"&gt;. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">Click here for a beginners' HTML5 tutorial</a>

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>CSS3:</span> Webpages don't only have content, they also have designs. In order to make your webpage look attractive to the user, you need to write code that customize the appearances of the elements on the page. CSS3 is the language used for styling your webpage and making it look how attractive you want it to look.
                                            Example, if you want the heading of some information on the web site to be of specific font, color, size, etc, you do that in CSS3 code, if you want the user's profile picture to be shaped as a circle  instead of a rectangle, you do that in CSS3 code as well. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">Click here for a beginners' CSS3 tutorial</a>

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>Javascript:</span> Modern websites are interactive; that is, the web pages don't get refreshed or redirected for every user click. Users are able to stay on the same webpage and perform various activities without having to refresh the webpage. This is achieved using Javascript code. 
                                            In order to add some interactivity to the webpages, you need to write javascript code which get executed inside the browser in response to various user activities. For example, when the user clicks on a drop-down menu icon, some javascript code is executed so that the actual drop-down menu appears on the screen. 
                                            Javascript can be quite heavy to get your head around if you have no prior programming experience. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" >Click here for a beginners' Javascript tutorial</a>

                                            As a  summary of what we've covered so far,  Frontend is the part of the application that the end user interacts with in order to use the application. It contains all the visual elements such as forms, buttons, menus, window panels, etc.
                                            In order to build this kind of presentation which can be displayed by the web browser, you create an html page which contains html elements written of the HTML5 language syntax, then add your design definitions using CSS3 code.
                                            Modern webpages aren't static pages with fixed contents, they allow the users to change parts of the webpages without having to refresh the pages all the time. Javascript is the language for implementing the behavioural part of the frontend.

                                            So far we've covered the first part of the application, now lets consider looking at the backend and how its different from the frontend.

                                            The backend  of every software application is that which the end user isn't allowed to directly access its code, instead, the user only gets a feel of what exists in the backend by invoking its functions through interacting with the frontend. 
                                            This part of the application is responsible for some of the most complex applications functions and processes, such as user authentication, database interaction, data processing etc. When it comes to the programming languages for building the backend,
                                            there is a vast variety of languages to learn in order to write backend code and these languages usually have steep learning curves. This blog isn't meant to teach any set of specific languages, but what I will be doing is briefly introducing some of the
                                            very popular backend languages so as to give you a feel of what the backend  may comprise of. Some backend languages to condiser include Java (not the same as Javascript), Python, C#, Ruby, PHP, and even Javascript ( yes, you can use javascript on the backend too, it is called Node.js ).

                                            As a summery of what the backend is, it is the non-visual part of your application which contains code that runs on the server side. The code in the backend is usuaslly invoked indirectly by the users through interacting with the front-end, thus some of the frontend elements or features connect to various processes and functions in the backed code. 
                                            This code isn't accessible to the end user however, but through their direct actions on frontend elements, the backend code is activated. Some of the common things the backend is used for are user authentication, database read, write, update, delete, etc. operations, complex data processing, etc. Java, C#, Python, Javascript, Ruby, PHP etc. are some of the most popular backend languages.

                                            The database is the data storage part of your application. It stores all the data that is generated by the end users and application processes in order to maintain data persistence. For example, if you need the users to create user accounts to be able to use the application, then you are going to need a place to store all this user generated data so that it can be later retrieved and used when needed. 
                                            Databases are a way to permanently store data. Databases come in two main general categories. These are the Relational or SQL databases and the NoSQL databases.

                                           Having covered all three main application concerns, the table is now set for us to look at what being a fullstack web developer means.

                                            A fullstack web developer is someone who has knowledge of all the three main application concerns and is able to piece everything together to build the whole application.
                                            As a fullstack web developer, you are required to have the knowledge that spans all three main appliction concerns ( frontend, backend, database). You don't have to be an expert in all three, but atleast having a good understanding of one facet of the software stack  and being average on all other parts is required to meet the expectations of a fullstack web developer.
                                            The most conventional way to begin your journey is to pick one particular aspect, usually the frontend, and start learning the technologies and languages involved in building that part of the application. Thus being a fullstack web developer is only the ultimate goal, therefore needless do you have to focus on learning all three areas of the application at the same time.

                                            As a beginner, It is not recommend that you wait until you can do all three application parts before applying for an entry-level position. Not only is that not very practical approach, it is also time consuming as each part of the software stack is a complex ecosystem yet to be explored in order to choose which technologies to learn and use. 
                                            Also companies are very skeptical, in accepting entry level positions for fullstack developers, since their salary demands are mostly higher than the frontend or backend developers. Another reason, especially for startup to mid-size companies, is that giving an individual who is of entry-level  knowledge, the entire tech stack of the company to manage is not a safe thing to do.

                                            Your best bet however is to learn and understand one particular application concern, usually the frontend, well enough to be job market ready for an entry-level position. Applying for entry-level frontend position increases your chances of landing your first job. It then becomes easy to gradually transition and become a fullstack web developer.

As for programming language choices, a freelance developer may have free will to choose which languages to use, which usually will depend on their carrear goals, 
                                            or may evolve depending on the types of projects that they take.The most important thing to consider when picking which languages to learn is that, the languages you pick are those that widthstand the test of time in this constantly changing software industry. This means that you have to keep an eye on current trends 
                                            and which general direction the web development industry has taken in order to choose the right tools and increase your chances of success and also prevent the possibilities of having to unlearn or relearn, or having to pick new technologies over the ones you're comfortable working with in the near future.

                                            Aside being able to write good code and implement effecient algorithms, it is reqiured by the current industry that you know some additional technologies in order to increases your developer efficiency and your chances of landing that first job. Some of these technologies to know are, source control, unit testing, package management, containerization etc. 
                                            I shall introduce them below and add links to resources where you can learn more.

                                           <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>Source Control: </span>Arguably, source control is the most demanded technology that you must learn to increase your chances with any employer out there. Source control also called version control is a way in which to keep track of changes made in the source files of a project. It is mostly very useful in 
                                           collaborative team projects, where it becomes neccesary to track changes and to maintain a more accurate and consistent code base. One of the most used source control system is called Github. Github lets you keep multiple snapshots or versions of the same souce code so that any changes made are trackable and reversible. Thus, Github allows to keep multiple
                                           versions of the same source code files, each version containing some level of changes and updates made to the code. When working on a team project, it is required that you can use the various git commands to add your code updates to the github server, and also to retrieve changes made by the other teammates from the github server. Also you have to be able to
                                           do some other required github activities other than adding your changes to the server and retieving the latest code updates. I wont be treating Github in this blog. <a href="https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners">Click here to learn more about Github.</a>

                                           <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>Package Management: </span>Mordern software systems are very complex that it becomes almost impossible to write every functionality and feature from scratch. Instead, developers depend on prewritten code by other developers to implement some of the freatures and functionality of the application they are working on.
                                           These are called the dependencies of that particular application. Downloading all the dependencies form distributed sources and adding them to the project is a tiduous and unreliable way. It can also cause problems to manage these dependencies during application maintainance. In order to overcome these challenges, these prewritten code are packaged and published in
                                           a centralized data store or registory usually called as the dependencies' repository. By linking your application to various packages in the repository, it becomes possible to include the functionalities in those packages without having to dowload the actual packages into your code. Some of these package managers include NPM, Yarn, NPX etc.
                                           <a href="https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/">Click here to learn more about NPM</a> . Yarn and NPX are only different flavours of the NPM. You may google Yarn or NPX to learn more.

Modern software systems are designed in a way whereby the individual functional parts or modules stand alone while serving some purpose for the software system. 
                                           This means that, each functional part of the system is independently deployable and is made available through interfaces where to communicate with the other parts of the system. In order to deploy these usually single-function software modules, you need light-weight hosting paltforms. Containers are lightweight platforms for such deployments. 
                                           One most popular container management system is Docker. <a href="https://stackify.com/docker-tutorial/ to learn Docker">Click here to learn more about docker</a>.

                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue;'>Unit Testing: </span>Depending on the development stage, software can be tested in one of four ways. Unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing, are the main types of software testing. Unit testing is usually the earliest form of testing which is done during developing the software system.
                                            Unit testing, as implied by the name, involves testing the individual units (ie. functions, classes, or other modules) of the software system. This is done after the developer has written the individual classes and functions and there is the need to test them before integerating them. After all the individual modules have been tested and found to be working properly, then
                                            the development process proceeds to integration stage where to combine the different modules of the system. It usually invovles an incremental integration of the subsystems while ensuring that each face of the integration is successful. After the entire system has been put together via integration and integration testing, it becomes neccessary to find out whether or not every
                                            feature and functionality of the system is working as specified. This is when it becomes important to test the entire system. System testing may involve, deploying the software and having user's use it in order to discover if any parts of it are flawed, or drifted away from the predefined system specifications. After the system has been built and thoroughly tested by the testing team,
                                            its main stakeholders are allowed to spend some time with it in order to collect feedback from them, this form of testing is called the acceptance testing. The main purpose of acceptance testing is to ensure that the stakeholders and users of the application are satisfied by the product, and also to know whether or not the product is able to solve the specific problem(s) it was designed and built to solve.
                                            As the developer, your main area of testing is going to be that of unit testing. This is true since you are going to need to test some of your code modules to ensure that the classes, functions, or code modules are working properly. Unit testing may involve using a third party liberay to make testing easier. One of such liberaries is JUnit which is used for testing Java code.
                                            Testing may also rely on specifications laid out in a test document, and may also pertain to a test case of some sort whose criteria bases on specified inputs and expected output from the test. Unit testing may especailly be recommended for backend development, as the backend is the part of the software system that's without any visual output to help the developer see whether or not the code is working.

                                            Over the years of web development, common practices and resuable approaches have become common patterns for building web applications. Among these documented and used patterns are some of the most frequently used Software Stacks. Each software stack is a different combination of some of the common technologies and languages which forms a different flavor of how web applications are built.
                                            Below are three examples of some common software stacks and their brief explanations.

                                            Now. Of all that's said, I hope you gained some valuable insights on how you can become a fulstack web developer. As a recap, A fullstack developer is someone who is capable of building
                                            the whole application, from the user interface (UI) to the business logic to data persistence. HTML, CSS and Javascript are the languages for building the UI. Java, C#, Javascript, PHP and Ruby are some of the
                                            common languages used to write the business logic. Relational and NoSQL databases are the two main flavors of database management systems. Being a fullstack developer requires that you know
                                            at least all the three frontend languages, at least one backend language, and also be able to design and create databases for data persistence.
