                                        <p style='font-size: 20px;'>Somewhere In 2011, I started out in IT as a computer hardware and networking engineer, and also database administrator. Three years later, perhaps of doing mostly database stuff and writing SQL code, I figured my passion is programming,
                                           so I decided to go full-time in the direction of software. Now as a self-made software engineer and architect,
                                           I design system software architecture, build systems fullstack-wise with modern frontend tech, and usually a java backend powered by Microsoft SQL server database.

                                        <p style='font-size: 20px;'>Since the last quarter of 2017, I have been writing and maintaining this particular web application called Queue, which is over a hundred thousand source lines of code (100KSLOC) - Queue lets people discover medical and beauty services and take line spots to book appointments,
                                            and also to view news updates that the businesses post to keep customers informed and engaged - <a href='http:/QueueWebAppPrototype/' style='font-size: 20px;'>Click here to see Queue</a>. As a founder, CEO and project coordinator at AriesLab, I've led my dev teams to
                                            substantial wins in various software projects. My most recent main focus has revolved around web development and software architecture with mastery on bare-bone coding in the various web dev programming languages.
                                            That means, I don't easily submit to cooky cutter solutions or frameworks, despite being able to do React, Java-Spring MVC and other frameworks. I also have years of experience in database development and administration
                                            which equips me with the ability to analyze, design, implement and maintain databases in MS SQL server using its respective management tools.

                                <p style='font-size: 20px;'>Whether you're studying CS in college or enrolled in a boot camp, or self-teaching yourself programming, one thing holds true - in all cases, you need to put in hours and hours
                                   of work to develop your skills. Software is one of the highly paying industries where a college degree isn't required to land your first job.
                                   However, in order to get a programming job, you need to be equipped with specific skills required in the industry. This skills-set comes in the form of
                                   trending technologies you need to know, specific CS topics you need to master, and also your ability to understand the tech ecosystem properly.

                                <p style='font-size: 20px;'>Hey there! My name is Mohammed Adinan. I'm 26 years old. I started out in IT when I was 18 years old. Over the course of 8 years in IT, out of which I've been doing
                                    software for 5 years now, I've become a software engineer and architect after writing and seeing so much code and doing some architecture works as well.
                                    As of 2014, I was traveling back and forth from Ghana (where I come from) to London to negotiate on hardware supply deals with London based hardware vendors
                                    on behalf of the Ghana Nation Youth Authority (N.Y.A), as I held a two year contract position as regional overall systems administrator and infrastructure coordinator of the NYA.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p style='font-size: 20px;'>
                                    In 2015, as my employment contract with the NYA was ending that year, I decided that I will establish a startup.
                                    Later that same year, I applied as NYA delegate to an upcoming UN Summit which was to be held here, in US. My application was successful, so I flew to NY.
                                    As I stayed in NY for some time, I felt it was a perfect opportunity for me to establish my Start-up in NY.
                                    I started a small software business called AriSoft which unfortunately didn't succeed. A year later, after months of market research, learning and gathering resources
                                    and also making some strategic connections in the industry, I felt prepared to start again.
                                    Now as founder, CEO and Project coordinator at AriesLab, I've led my dev teams at AriesLab in many software projects to substantial successes. I've written and seen so much code, designed systems architectures, and managed
                                    my teams in technical areas, leading the company to many successes.

                                    Technology has become really complex nowadays, knowing only how to code isn't enough to justify your programmer capabilities. Programmers are expected to know, in addition to being able to write good code and implement effective algorithms, a handful of technologies
                                    and also how to use some specific tools in order to fit in the job-market. As a beginner, in order to be able to navigate this complex ecosystem of
                                    technologies, you will need some help to identify what you should be learning, the order in which to pick and learn those needed technologies, and how to know when you're ready to start applying to jobs.
                                    Having someone who is experienced in tech, who can guide you through this journey is invaluable, I guess.

                                            Web applications usually have 3 main different layers: The Frontend, Backend and Database. Each one of these layers of the application has a different
                                            set of responsibilities which it is meant to contribute to the overall application's functionalities.
                                            In order to be a fullstack web developer, you must have the knowledge that spans everything from the frontend to the backend to the database (We'll talk about what each one of these is in a bit).
                                            Quite not literally do you have to know every little piece of information about all three layers in order to become a fullstack developer. However, you must at least have good enough knowledge on each one of these layers in order to be able to build a fully working application, since that's going to be mostly your responsibility as a fullstack developer

                                            This blog is a beginners' guide for absolute beginners who aspire to become fullstack web developers, therefore, if you're already either a frontend or a backend developer and you are looking for some advanced material
                                            on how to transition and become a fullstack web developer, then this blog may not satisfy all your needs. However, since it contains most of the important things to know for aspiring fullstack web
                                            developers, it can give you some relevant insights which will help make any resources you pick up later more meaningful.

                                            As with the order in which I approach this blog content, I'll be introducing the frontend first, then to the backend, and then to the database layer. We'll also be discussing some of the sideliner technologies which are also as relevant as the main technologies or languages used on the three main layers of the fullstack web development.
                                            Some of these sideliner technologies are source control, unit testing, package management, etc. We'll also take a look at some various web development frameworks. Frameworks provide developers with pre-written code and various tools which help make web development easier for them.
                                            Then lastly, I'll also introduce some of the different ways that various frontend technologies together with various backend and database technologies are stacked(or combined) in varying ways that makeup different flavors of fullstack web applications. These combinations of frontend technologies with backend and database technologies that makeup the whole web applications are called as the Software Stacks.

                                            Without any further ado, lets start breaking it down in order to give you the bigger and better picture on how you can become a fullstack web developer.

                                          The Frontend is the part of the application that the end users interact with. Its main purpose is to provide the end user with some form of visual presentation where to interact with the application. It is the web page part of the application whose code translates directly to the visual components such as buttons, menus, images, texts, etc. that the users see on the web page.
                                          The diagram below demonstrates how the frontend(browser), the backend and the database exist relative to each other.

                                            There are 3 main languages to learn in order to start building the frontend part of your application: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp" style='font-size: 20px;'>HTML5</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" style='font-size: 20px;'>CSS3</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" style='font-size: 20px;'>Javascript</a>.

                                            This blog wont dive into any particular programming language, instead I'll give you a brief explanation of what each language is responsible for. I'll then include links for resources to learn more about some of the programming languages I'll be introducing in this blog.

                                        <p style='font-size: 20px;'>
                                            <span style='font-weight: bolder; color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>HTML5:</span> Every web page is made up of elements (like text, pictures, forms, boxes and other shapes, etc) which define the content of the web page. These Elements are coded into a file with a <span style='color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>".html"</span> file extension and is of the HTML syntax.
                                            This makes it possible for the web browsers to read and display the web page from the file. The web page elements are represented in code using HTML tags. The HTML elements are usually made up of an open and a close tags (like so, <span style='color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>&lt;openTag&gt; content here &lt;/closeTag&gt;</span>).
                                            In between the open and close tags is where to put the main content of the element which should be displayed on the web page. Elements have names which you place inside of the open and close tags (like so, <span style='color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>&lt;elementName&gt; content here &lt;/elementName&gt;</span>), and properties/attributes which you can only place in
                                            the <span style='color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>&lt;openTag&gt;</span> in the form of <span style='color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>property="value"</span> (like so <span style='color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;'>&lt;elementName property="value"&gt;</span>). The element names and attributes help the browser understand what type of element they are and how to display them on the web page.
                                            The picture below is a typical example of an HTML element for adding paragraphs to your web page. It has a default element name of "p", and one "class" attribute with the attribute value as "nice". You need not to worry about what a class attribute is for now, of course that is if you don't already know what it is. You can learn about that later when you click on the HTML5 link I've provided below. This picture is only meant to demonstrate to you how HTML elements are constructed.

Also, the design makes it easy for the users to find the various components of the User Interface (UI for short. UI is another name for the web page). This makes it easy for the users to use the application which, as a result, improves the feeling they experience while using the application.
                                            In order to make your web page look attractive to the user, you need to write code that customize the appearances of the elements on the page. CSS3 is the language used for styling your webpage and making it look how attractive you want it to look.
                                            Example, if you want the heading of some information on the web site to be of specific font, color, size, etc, you do that in CSS3 code, if you want the user's profile picture to be shaped as a circle  instead of a rectangle, you do that in CSS3 code as well. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" style='font-size: 20px;'>Click here for a beginners' CSS3 tutorial</a>

Users are able to stay on the same web page while performing various activities that change the contents on different parts of the same web page without having to refresh the webpage. This is achieved using Javascript code.
                                            In order to add such interactivity to the webpages, you need to write javascript code. The javascript code gets executed inside the browser in response to various user activities. For example, when the user clicks on a drop-down menu icon, some javascript function is executed so that the actual drop-down menu appears on the screen.
                                            Javascript can be quite heavy to get your head around if you have no prior programming experience. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" style='font-size: 20px;'>Click here for a beginners' Javascript tutorial</a>

                                            As a  summary of what we've covered so far,  Frontend is the part of the application that the end user interacts with in order to use the application. It contains all the visual elements such as forms, buttons, menus, window panels, etc.
                                            In order to build the type of User Interface which can be displayed by the web browser, you create a HTML file which contains HTML elements written of the HTML5 language syntax, then add your design definitions using CSS3 code.
                                            Modern web pages allow the users to change the contents on different parts of the page without having to refresh the entire page. Javascript code lets the end users run functions that help them interact with different parts of the web page without needing a full page refresh.

                                            The backend  of every software application is that which the end user isn't allowed to directly access its code. Instead, the user only gets a feel of what exists in the backend by invoking (same as activating) the functions that exists there through interacting with the frontend.
                                            This part of the application is responsible for most of the very complex applications functions and processes, such as user authentication, database interaction, and most of the complex data processing, etc. When it comes to the programming languages for building the backend,
                                            there is quite many variety of languages that you can learn and use. The backend languages usually have steep learning curves. This blog isn't meant to teach any set of languages, but what I will do is, introduce some of the
                                            very popular backend languages and then give you some general information about each one of them so that you can understand the differences among the languages. Some backend languages to condiser include C++, Java (not the same as Javascript), Python, C# or .Net, Ruby, PHP, and even Javascript ( yes, you can use javascript on the backend too, it is called Node.js ).

Programmers working with C++ need to think about where data gets stored. This is called memory management (sometimes pointer arithmetic), and it’s very difficult	to learn but once you understand it, you understand how	computers work at a very deep level.
                                            C++	is based off of	the C language,	which is very similar  to C++.	Most other programming	languages are build in the C language. However, there really aren’t that many jobs for developers working with C or C++. Still, it’s an important part of the programming language discussion.

Java’s syntax is heavily based on C++, but it provides garbage collection with C++ style syntax.  This generally makes Java easier to write and work with than C++.

                                            Python’s syntax looks very familiar to Ruby, so if you learn one language it’s pretty easy to pick up the other. There’s one aspect of Python that developers like to discuss, and it’s that it is incredibly "white space sensitive." This means that the space character needs to be perfect for your code to work. People tend to either love this or hate it

When javascript is used in the back-end it’s called "NodeJS."  NodeJS is exactly the same as javascript, except it indicates that it is JavaScript that is not running in the front-end.
                                            javascript has a number of complicated language features that make it a good choice to learn once you’ve mastered a different programming language.
                                            Things that make javascript hard to learn as a first language are anonymous functions, callbacks, prototypical inheritance. Complicated topics like these are deeply ingrained into javaScript, so even to understand basic code you need to understand a few very complex computer science topics.
                                            It’s much easier to learn javascript after becoming a competent programmer in other languages first.

It’s a good option to choose for a first programming language. It’s used by companies like AirBnB, BaseCamp, Groupon and Github.
                                            The learning curve to master Ruby is less steep in comparison to other programming languages, and after just a short period, you’re able to write and execute Ruby programs. Ruby really stays out of your way as a developer, and if you’re going to be learning advanced
                                            algorithms it’s a great language to work with them. Think of it as the springboard to learning other programming languages later on at an accelerated pace.

Now, however, companies that run PHP code are generally using older technologies instead of cutting edge ones. PHP is very polarizing. People either love it, or people think that it’s an old, dying language.
                                            Wordpress is built off PHP,	which has played a significant role in its success. Because of this, many PHP developers are hired to modify PHP blogs.

                                            As a summery of what the backend is, it is the non-visual part of your application which contains code that runs on the server side. The code in the backend is usuaslly invoked indirectly by the users through interacting with the front-end, thus some of the frontend elements or features connect to various processes and functions in the backed code.
                                            The backend code isn't accessible to the end user however, but through their direct actions on frontend elements, the backend code is activated. Some of the common things the backend is used for are user authentication, database read, write, update, delete, etc. operations, complex data processing, etc. C++, Java, C#, Python, Javascript, Ruby, PHP etc. are some of the most popular backend languages.

                                            The database is the data storage part of your application. It stores all the data that is generated from the end users activities and also from some automated application processes. This helps to maintain the persistence for such user and application process data. For example, if users have to create user accounts in order to use the application, then it will be more efficient to provide a centralized storage location where to keep all the data so that it can be later retrieved and used by the various users.
                                            Databases are a way to permanently store data. Databases come in two main general categories. The first type of database is called the Relational databases (also called SQL databases. SQL is pronounced as sequel). And the second type is the NoSQL (pronounced as No-sequel) databases.

There are several implementations of SQL that are generally used in production: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL.
                                            You can connect to these databases with almost any programming language pretty easily.  Although each implementation has slight quirks that cause it to be slightly different than the other implementations, the implementations are basically identical with small changes that are pretty easy to pick up.
                                            Once you learn one implementation of SQL, you should be able to be comfortable in other ones. It’s much like learning English in the UK or the US, there are some differences, but the fundamental	language is usually the	same.
                                            When you think about the data, it will be stored in a manner similar to an excel sheet: there are tables in the database, which has columns and rows.  And similar to keeping your excel columns understandable, SQL requires you to specify the columns headers up-front.
                                            SQL is a tried and true database and is used by many modern web applications.  Yahoo! uses PostgreSQL extensively, and Google and Facebook both use MySQL.

Instead of having a defined	structure, they allow you to have lists of databases and push anything into the list regardless of the structure.
                                            Inconsistencies can exist in how the data is stored.  It’s generally considered a bad idea to do so.  You’ll generally want entries to have a consistent structure, but the NoSQL database is flexible and	will accept anything.
                                            There are a	number	of different NoSQL databases: MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB, Redis.
                                            Currently, we don’t really have a standard for how data should be stored inside of NoSQL databases, so each NoSQL database will be considerably different. That means if you learn one type of NoSQL database, it won’t translate well to any other implementations.
                                            MongoDB is one of the most popular implementations of NoSQL databases.  It has a few features that allow for some  interesting properties while scaling up an application to millions of users with hundreds of millions of database requests (or building applications at so-called WebScale).
                                            Mongo’s features make it a good solution for ad servers and other applications that need to	handle hundreds	of millions of requests	a day. On the flip side, it makes it a poor choice for things like marketplaces, eCommerce sites, or other sites that handle less than 10 million requests per day (which is most web applications)

                                            A fullstack web developer is someone who has knowledge of all the three main application concerns and is able to piece everything together to build the whole application.
                                            As a fullstack web developer, you are required to have the knowledge that spans all three main appliction concerns (frontend, backend, database). You don't have to be an expert in all three, but you should atleast have a good understanding of one layer of the software stack and be at least average on the other layers. This ensures that you meet the expectations from a fullstack web developer.
                                            As a convention, you can pick only one application stack layer - usually the frontend - and learn the languages and technologies involved in building that part of the application. Then as you get comfortable working on that application layer you've picked, gradually start working on the other layers too. This ensures that you don't pickup random topics across all application parts and confuse yourself. It also ensure an effective and incremental approach to become a fullstack web developer.
                                            Thus being a fullstack web developer is only the ultimate goal, therefore needless do you have to focus on learning all three areas of the application at the same time.

                                            Web application frameworks help developers do things that happen many times in most web applications with only a few lines of code (instead of dozens or even hundreds of lines of code.) These frameworks make life easier as a developer because they allow you to focus on features that you care about, rather than mundane, repetitive tasks.
                                            If you’re building a web application, you should definitely	use a web application framework to help you do the work. Just like with programming languages, you’ll need to choose a framework to learn. In general, if you’ve picked a programming language, there's a common web application framework that you should learn, too. The main web application framework that developers are using include:
                                            RUBY ON RAILS Ruby on Rails is a web framework that focuses on developer happiness. Its core principle is Convention over Configuration. What does this mean? Even though there are many ways you can do a particular thing, there is a certain way that the ruby community will deem "correct". If you do things the correct way, your life will be easier. You’ll	find that once you understand how one application works, you’ll	notice that other applications that are written by other developers will be organized in a remarkably similar manner.
                                            EXPRESSJS ExpressJS is a web framework that runs on NodeJS. It’s an un-opinionated web framework, meaning that it doesn’t make your life easier if you do things the "right way". Overall, remember that once you learn one web framework, you’ll be able to learn other frameworks	very quickly. The hard stuff to	learn about web	application development	applies to all frameworks equally: you need to understand databases, REST, HTTP requests and more. If you’re good at Rails, you’ll be able to pick up Node/ExpressJS very quickly. If you’re good at ExpressJS, you’ll be able to pick up Rails quickly.
                                            DJANGO Django is an MVC framework, very similar to Ruby on Rails. A ruby on rails developer could pick-up the basics of Django fairly quickly and the reverse is true too.

                                            As a beginner, It is not recommend that you wait until you can do all three application layers before applying for an entry-level position. Not only is that not very practical approach, it is also time consuming as each part of the software stack is a complex ecosystem yet to be explored in order to choose which technologies to learn and use.
                                            Also companies are very skeptical, in accepting entry level positions for fullstack developers, since their salary demands are mostly higher than the frontend or backend developers. Another reason, especially for startup to mid-size companies, is that giving an individual who is of entry-level  knowledge, the entire tech stack of the company to manage is not a safe thing to do.

                                            Your best bet however is to learn and understand the languages and technologies used at one layer of the stack, usually the frontend, well enough to be job market ready for an entry-level position. Applying for entry-level frontend position increases your chances of landing your first job. It then becomes easy to gradually transition and become a fullstack web developer.

Source control also called version control is a way in which to keep track of changes made in the source files of a project. It is mostly very useful in
                                           collaborative team projects, where it becomes necessary to track changes and to maintain a more accurate and consistent code base. One of the most used source control system is called Github. Github lets you keep multiple snapshots or versions of the same source code so that any changes made can be tracked. This makes it possible to revers changes to previous versions of the code. Thus, Github allows to keep multiple
                                           versions of the same source code files, each version containing some level of changes and updates made to the code. When working on a team project, it is required that you can use the various git commands to add your code updates to the github server, and also to retrieve changes made by the other teammates from the github server. Also you have to be able to
                                           do some other required Github activities other than adding your changes to the server and retrieving the latest code updates.

Instead, developers depend on pre-written code by other developers to implement some of the features and functionality of the application they are working on.
                                           These are called the dependencies of that particular application. Downloading all the dependencies form distributed sources and adding them to the project is a tedious and unreliable way. It can also cause problems to manage these dependencies during application maintenance. In order to overcome these challenges, these pre-written code are packaged and published in
                                           a centralized data store or registry usually called as the dependencies' repository. By linking your application to various packages in the repository, it becomes possible to include the functionalities in those packages without having to download the actual packages into your code. Some of these package managers include NPM, Yarn, NPX etc.
                                           <a href="https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/" style='font-size: 20px;'>Click here to learn more about NPM</a> . Yarn and NPX are only different flavors of the NPM. You may google Yarn or NPX to learn more.

Modern software systems are designed in a way whereby the individual functional parts or modules stand alone while serving some purpose for the software system.
                                           This means that, each functional part of the system is independently deployable and is made available through interfaces where to communicate with the other parts of the system. In order to deploy these usually single-function software modules, you need light-weight hosting platforms. Containers are lightweight platforms for such deployments.
                                           One most popular container management system is Docker. <a href="https://stackify.com/docker-tutorial/ to learn Docker" style='font-size: 20px;'>Click here to learn more about docker</a>.

Unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing, are the main types of software testing. Unit testing is usually the earliest form of testing which is done during developing the software system.
                                            Unit testing, as implied by the name, involves testing the individual units (ie. functions, classes, or other modules) of the software system. This is done after the developer has written the individual classes and functions and there is the need to test them before integrating them. After all the individual modules have been tested and found to be working properly, then
                                            the development process proceeds to integration stage where to combine the different modules of the system. It usually invovles an incremental integration of the subsystems while ensuring that each face of the integration is successful. After the entire system has been put together via integration and integration testing, it becomes necessary to find out whether or not every
                                            feature and functionality of the system is working as specified. This is when it becomes important to test the entire system. System testing may involve, deploying the software and having user's use it in order to discover if any parts of it are flawed, or drifted away from the predefined system specifications. After the system has been built and thoroughly tested by the testing team,
                                            its main stakeholders are allowed to spend some time with it in order to collect feedback from them, this form of testing is called the acceptance testing. The main purpose of acceptance testing is to ensure that the stake-holders and users of the application are satisfied by the product, and also to know whether or not the product is able to solve the specific problem(s) it was designed and built to solve.
                                            As the developer, your main area of testing is going to be that of unit testing. This is true since you are going to need to test some of your code modules to ensure that the classes, functions, or code modules are working properly. Unit testing may involve using a third party library to make testing easier. One of such libraries is JUnit which is used for testing Java code.
                                            Testing may also rely on specifications laid out in a test document, and may also pertain to a test case of some sort whose criteria bases on specified inputs and expected output from the test. Unit testing may especially be recommended for backend development, as the backend is the part of the software system that's without any visual output to help the developer see whether or not the code is working.

                                           For example, If you want to include the weather information from different parts of the world in your application, you are likely to have to get that data from an API that serves such functionality on the Internet. I shouldn't have to tell you that it will be almost impossible that you install your own weather sensors across the globe in order to collect the weather data from different parts of the world. Good news is, 
                                           the weather sensors have already been put in place and somewhere on the internet, there ara APIs that lets you get this information easily. Therefore it would be pointless, even if possible, to have to do all that extra work to build your application). So what at all is Postman? Since you are going to be using these APIs, it becomes important to test the outputs from those APIs usually when you have some error in your system in order to debug your code.
                                           Even as you advance in your carrier as a fullstack developer, you are sometimes going to be required to build some of these APIs yourself. This is usually true, when having to build small pieces of application modules that integrate together to makeup the entire software system. Yet at other times too, your frontend code might be totally separated from your backend, and the usual way in which to reach the backend is to build such APIs to reach the backend.
                                          Postman is an API build and testing tool. With Postman, you can build and test your APIs as you build them, in other to ensure a working API is built.

                                            Over the years of web development, common practices and resuable approaches have become common patterns for building web applications. Among these documented and used patterns are some of the most frequently used Software Stacks. Each software stack is a different combination of some of the common technologies and languages which forms a different flavor of how web applications are built.
                                            Below are three examples of some common software stacks and their brief explanations.

                                            Now. Of all that's said, I hope you gained some valuable insights on how you can become a fulstack web developer. As a recap, A fullstack developer is someone who is capable of building
                                            the whole application, from the user interface (UI) to the business logic to data persistence. HTML, CSS and Javascript are the languages for building the UI. Java, C#, Javascript, PHP and Ruby are some of the
                                            common languages used to write the business logic. Relational and NoSQL databases are the two main flavors of database management systems. Being a fullstack developer requires that you know
                                            at least all the three frontend languages, at least one backend language, and also be able to design and create databases for data persistence.
